# Sliding
 <p>This NFT is a white bordered page with 4 ovals sliding across the screen in a diagonal line at a rate of 10s for a 100%.
 It changes six different colors then disappears to reappear on the other side of the screen and it does this forever. 
 I used the animation feature of CSS to get the shapes to move and to change their positions. Then I styled them to be ovals and change colors at a certain percent of completion.</p>
